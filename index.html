Prog4 is database-driven web application that has the functionality
of a online store supermarket, as well as the main interface for
employees and managers in the store. Website was designed to work
by querying and storing information in our oracle DB with the use
of a servlet database controller that serves as the middle-tier to
transfer information between the front-end and the back-end. Each webpage
has its own header comment with a description of the functionality they
perform. Refer to those header comments for more information on how the
whole site works.

<!--Index contains the login screen for our main program. 
Once valid credentials are entered. You get redirected 
to a specific interface depending on userType -->
